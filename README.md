# driver_drowsiness-detection
Week 1: Research & Planning
✅ Understand the Problem Statement

Define the scope and purpose of the project.

Research existing methods for drowsiness detection (e.g., eye-tracking, yawning detection, heart rate monitoring).

✅ Gather Required Resources

Select the dataset (public datasets like NTHU DDD, YawDD, or create your own).

Identify required hardware (camera, sensors if needed).

Choose the development tools (Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, dlib, etc.).

✅ Set Up the Development Environment

Install necessary libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install opencv-python dlib imutils numpy scipy keras tensorflow
Set up version control (GitHub, GitLab).

Plan the project timeline and tasks.
